#In this project, I conducted an extensive analysis of San Francisco crime data to derive valuable insights that can inform law enforcement strategies and community safety measures. Spatial and temporal analyses were performed to identify top dangerous districts, and subsequent queries were executed to reveal crime trends based on categories and hours. The analysis involved both clustering techniques and OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) to extract meaningful patterns from the data.
